### Short overview of APEX, Zygote and Conscrypt

#### Conscrypt

The **Conscrypt** module enhances security improvements and device security without requiring OTA updates. It provides Android's **TLS implementation** and a significant portion of its **cryptographic functionality** (e.g., key generators, ciphers, and message digests).

#### **Key Features**
- **Open Source Library:**
  - Available as open source, with specializations in the Android platform.
- **TLS and Cryptographic Functions:**
  - Implements TLS and cryptographic functionality using Java code and a native library.

#### **Use of BoringSSL**
- **BoringSSL:** 
  - A native library that is a Google fork of OpenSSL.
  - Used in many Google products, including Google Chrome, for cryptography and TLS.
  - **Characteristics:**
    - No official releases (users build from head).
    - No guarantees for API or ABI stability.

#### Zygote

The Zygote is the root process in Android, responsible for managing system and app processes with the same Application Binary Interface (ABI).

#### **Zygote Tasks**

1. **Initialization:**
   - Spawned by the `init` daemon during Android OS startup.
   - Dual architecture systems may have both 64-bit and 32-bit Zygote processes.

2. **Process Management:**
   - **Unspecialized App Processes (USAP):**
     - Preconfigured processes for faster app launches.
     - Requires enabling via system property or ADB command.
     - **Workflow:**
       - System server connects to a USAP via Unix domain socket.
       - USAP is preconfigured (PID, cgroup, etc.) and allocated to an app.
       - Pool is replenished when USAP count drops to one or fewer.

   - **Lazy Evaluation:**
     - Zygote spawns processes on demand.
     - **Workflow:**
       - System server sends a command to Zygote via Unix domain socket.
       - Zygote forks a new process and configures it (PID, cgroup, etc.).
       - Process sends its PID back to Zygote, which relays it to the system server.

#### APEX

### **APEX File Format**

The **Android Pony EXpress (APEX)** file format was introduced in Android 10 to manage the installation and updates of lower-level system modules. It allows updates to components outside the standard Android application model, such as native services, libraries, HALs (Hardware Abstraction Layers), runtime (ART), and class libraries.

#### **Key Features**
- **Purpose:** Enables updates to low-level system components not suited for the APK (Android application) model.
- **Example Components:**
  - Native services and libraries.
  - Hardware Abstraction Layers (HALs).
  - Android Runtime (ART).
  - Class libraries.

#### **Background**
- **Challenges with APK for System Modules:**
  - APK-based modules cannot be used early in the boot sequence because:
    - The package manager, central to app info, starts later in the boot process.
    - The APK format (including its manifest) is designed for apps and doesn't align with system modules' needs.

#### **Design Overview**
- **APEX File Format:**
  - Specifically tailored to support lower-level OS components.
- **APEX Manager:**
  - A service responsible for managing APEX files.
